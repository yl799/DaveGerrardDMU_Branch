# Syntax

The repository is structured with subfolders, and one of these subfolders is named "Syntax." This "Syntax" subfolder includes both a lexer and a parser. The purpose of this lexer and parser is to process input and generate an output value, which belongs to the "Input" category and is sourced from the "Formula" folder. In essence, the "Syntax" subfolder is responsible for transforming input text into structured data that can be further used and processed within the system.
